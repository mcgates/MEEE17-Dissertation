\\Microgrids (MG) are small-scale power subsystems that incorporate distributed generation, energy storage, local loads, system control, and coordination. Energy Management Systems (EMS) play a crucial role in fortifying the resilience of microgrids, ensuring their stability and continued operation even when energy supply is constrained. EMS enables centralized monitoring and control of energy consumption across various building systems. It is designed to collect, store, and analyze power consumption data from residential and industrial appliances.
To achieve a fully automated and stable grid with plug-and-play capabilities, an agent-based EMS is proposed for use in a DC microgrid. This paper introduces an energy management system utilizing a systems-of-systems approach. We model and simulate an energy management system for a PV/Composite Storage DC microgrid in MATLAB. The primary aim of this paper is to enhance the performance of the DC Microgrid by integrating an existing grid with an energy management system at the residential level. The control system's objective is to ensure prolonged operation of loads by maintaining the local battery's charge until the PV modules cease power generation. Four scenarios of varying load demand were tested. The results obtained from both scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of this control system design approach.
